01:40 < tilgovi> and you can run `twistd -n -y /etc/lounge/smartproxy.tac` to run smartproxy
01:40 < mdas> oh okay, haha i'm already running into issues trying to start nginx since its  looking for files store in *nix directories like /lib/ ... perhaps i'll try to run 
              this on a linux box, or hack it to work on mac haha
01:40 < tilgovi> if you just want to get started and you have access to a *nix box, I would do that
01:41 < tilgovi> if you want to tinker I'd appreciate hearing about any progress you make on os x
01:41 < mdas> good call, thanks!
01:41 < mdas> for sure, it could be a pet project, this whole company is on macs haha
01:41 < tilgovi> I know srlindsay, one of the other devs, got it running on his mac
01:41 < tilgovi> so it is possible
01:41 < mdas> oh neat sure
01:42 < mdas> thanks for your help!
01:42 < tilgovi> of course! good luck
01:43 < mdas> once i fix the config file in /etc/lounge and get smart and dumb proxy running, it *should* work right? or am i missing some steps?
01:45 < tilgovi> should work!
01:45 < tilgovi> :)
01:45 < mdas> excellent, thanks!
01:46 < tilgovi> if you only access the lounge through dumbproxy on one of your two nodes technically you'll only need /etc/lounge/shards.conf changed on that machine
01:46 < tilgovi> but you can run dumbproxy on both if you copy shards.conf to both
01:46 < Monty> bending notes, maybe more general principle that Dickinson wouldn't be okay, what number
01:47 < tilgovi> and you can load balance between multiple smartproxy instances so that both machines are doing re-reductions by listing them both in /etc/lounge/nginx/nginx.conf
01:47 < tilgovi> that should be enough for you to play for a while

01:26 < mdas> anyone out there using couchdb-lounge?
01:26 < tilgovi> mdas: yes :)
01:26 < tilgovi> what's going on?
01:26 < tilgovi> err..what's on your mind?
01:28 -!- jchris [n=Adium@couchdb/developer/jchris] has quit [Client Quit]
01:29 < mdas> tilgovi: wow, meebo man himself:P  thanks for responding
01:30 < mdas> I'm basically trying to set up two couchdb instances, with replicated data, and i'd like to use lounge to distribute the load between the two
01:30 < mdas> buuuut I'm not sure where to start or even how to use lounge.  I just got it, but I'm not finding much in the documentation.  Any pointers would be appreciated!
01:32 < tilgovi> getting it built and installed is the first step
01:32 < tilgovi> there is some documentation on that, but it's not amazing
01:32 < mdas> yup that's been done
01:32 < tilgovi> till_ just did this as well
01:32 -!- alisdair [n=alisdair@d154-5-49-5.bchsia.telus.net] has joined #couchdb
01:32 < tilgovi> ok
01:32 < tilgovi> make sure you're not being bitten by http://github.com/tilgovi/couchdb-lounge/issues#issue/13
01:33 -!- BrianTheCoder [n=williams@adsl-209-30-190-193.dsl.rcsntx.swbell.net] has quit []
01:33 < tilgovi> and then try to start the proxies
01:34 < tilgovi> start the services nginx-lounge and smartproxy
01:34 < tilgovi> and make sure couch is running
01:34 < tilgovi> configuration is in /etc/lounge
01:35 < tilgovi> you'll want to check out shards.conf, which defaults to splitting the database into two shards, both stored on your local couch
01:35 < tilgovi> and you'll probably need to patch your couchdb with the provided patch if you haven't yet
01:35 < tilgovi> if you can help me out with any more specifics I can answer better
01:35 < mdas> okay, cool, i'll check the conf file bug, and i've patched up my couchdb install
01:35 < mdas> but I'm not sure how to actually start nginx-lounge/smartproxy/dumbproxy
01:36 < tilgovi> ahh. what distro?
01:36 < tilgovi> btw, nginx-lounge = dumbproxy
01:36 < mdas> oh thanks
01:36 < mdas> i'm running on os x
01:36 < tilgovi> oooh. I don't think anyone has done this on os x yet :)
01:37 < mdas> hahah, there's a first for everything
01:37 < mdas> :P
01:37 < mdas> how would it be done in *nix?
01:37 < tilgovi> /etc/init.d/nginx-lounge start
01:38 < tilgovi> I'm not sure how to package and deal with daemons on os x
01:38 < tilgovi> but you can just run nginx-lounge to start dumbproxy
01:40 < tilgovi> and you can run `twistd -n -y /etc/lounge/smartproxy.tac` to run smartproxy
01:40 < mdas> oh okay, haha i'm already running into issues trying to start nginx since its  looking for files store in *nix directories like /lib/ ... perhaps i'll try to run 
              this on a linux box, or hack it to work on mac haha
01:40 < tilgovi> if you just want to get started and you have access to a *nix box, I would do that
01:41 < tilgovi> if you want to tinker I'd appreciate hearing about any progress you make on os x
01:41 < mdas> good call, thanks!
01:41 < mdas> for sure, it could be a pet project, this whole company is on macs haha
01:41 < tilgovi> I know srlindsay, one of the other devs, got it running on his mac
01:41 < tilgovi> so it is possible
01:41 < mdas> oh neat sure
01:42 < mdas> thanks for your help!
01:42 < tilgovi> of course! good luck
01:43 < mdas> once i fix the config file in /etc/lounge and get smart and dumb proxy running, it *should* work right? or am i missing some steps?
01:45 < tilgovi> should work!
01:45 < tilgovi> :)
01:45 < mdas> excellent, thanks!
01:46 < tilgovi> if you only access the lounge through dumbproxy on one of your two nodes technically you'll only need /etc/lounge/shards.conf changed on that machine
01:46 < tilgovi> but you can run dumbproxy on both if you copy shards.conf to both
01:46 < Monty> bending notes, maybe more general principle that Dickinson wouldn't be okay, what number
01:47 < tilgovi> and you can load balance between multiple smartproxy instances so that both machines are doing re-reductions by listing them both in /etc/lounge/nginx/nginx.conf
01:47 < tilgovi> that should be enough for you to play for a while

18:31 <tilgovi> be sure you set permissions for the couchdb user to write to /var/log/lounge/replicator
18:31 <tilgovi> or the replication_notifier will crash

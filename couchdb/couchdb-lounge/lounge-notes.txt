1) Investigate why twistd doesn't write a pid file.
2) Fix start script.
3) Investigate why nginx-lounge can't read nginx.conf


01:43 < mdas> once i fix the config file in /etc/lounge and get smart and dumb proxy running, it *should* work right? or am i missing some steps?
01:45 < tilgovi> should work!
01:45 < tilgovi> :)
01:45 < mdas> excellent, thanks!
01:46 < tilgovi> if you only access the lounge through dumbproxy on one of your two nodes technically you'll only need /etc/lounge/shards.conf changed on that machine
01:46 < tilgovi> but you can run dumbproxy on both if you copy shards.conf to both
01:46 < Monty> bending notes, maybe more general principle that Dickinson wouldn't be okay, what number
01:47 < tilgovi> and you can load balance between multiple smartproxy instances so that both machines are doing re-reductions by listing them both in /etc/lounge/nginx/nginx.conf
01:47 < tilgovi> that should be enough for you to play for a while
